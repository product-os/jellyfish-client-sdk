        This brings in a major change to how AutumnDB handles sessions and
        although it isn't a breaking change for the client SDK it is technically
        incompatible with previous server versions.

        See product-os/autumndb#1363

      hash: d948e052702bd76cdc7210bd300c2b9d4cb869d5
      body: |
        Requests to Jellyfish are not currently idempotent, making automatic
        retries unsafe. We've seen multiple incidents in production where
        a non-200 HTTP status code is generated, but the contract has still been
        correctly created, resulting in multiple entities being created.

      body: |
        The SDK exports a `SdkQueryOptions` type which extends from the core's
        `QueryOptions`, which means this dependency is not dev-only.

      hash: 8a6f39b710b2e7e70ff0a023527576d23218543a
      body: |
        When querying the API the cursor requests one additional item. This
        overscan is used to see if there is another page of data available, but
        shouldn't be returned to the callee. This change trims the data set to
        the size of `options.limit` before returning it.

      hash: b044456c2e6716af463681d5ca060cfc4326f981
      body: |
        The initial `connect` reaction and `query` emission are vital for
        correctly initialising the database stream correctly. I initially
        changed this because I made the mistake that the `query` event caused
        a full query to be run, which isn't the case.

      hash: 7cdb2d7e212a7d17b4d4dc998bb20b6aab3ec5ed
      body: |
        Previously, whenever `loginWithToken` was called, it would automatically
        refresh the token. This is quite resource intensive and has now been
        changed to the more lightweight approach of simply checking the current
        tokens expiration date.

    - subject: Add support for sdk.globalQueryMask
      hash: 64ca96035d05bead47f15925021d93c626b34284
      body: >
        The global mask is a schema that will be applied to all subsequent
        queries. The global mask can be 'cleared' (unset) by setting it to
        `null`.


        You can also manually ignore the global query schema when calling `query()`, `view()` or `stream()` by passing `ignoreMask: true` in the `options` argument.

      hash: d6a012e749a2ee82c5d6ed61d1456e46849560e7
      body: >
        Loops will not be associated using links but with a top-level 'loop'
        field on each contract. This commit removes some link constraints that
        were recently added but are no longer appropriate. Although this
        constitutes a major bump there should be no problem with removing these
        link constraints as they were not being used yet.


        Note - there are still link-constraints defined between loops & contract-repository and loops & transformers. These will be removed at a later time once the code that relies on these links has been updated.
